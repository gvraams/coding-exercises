module SoftDeletable
  # "Mark as Deleted" - Custom implementation on top of Discard gem
  #
  # Implemented methods:
  # Mark for deletion:
  #  :soft_delete [Sets deleted_at for a record]
  #  :soft_delete_all [Sets deleted_at for a collection of records]
  #  :soft_destroy [Sets deleted_at for a record & invokes callbacks]
  #  :soft_destroy_all [Sets deleted_at for a collection of records & invokes callbacks]
  #
  # Restore records:
  #  :undo_delete [Unsets deleted_at for a record]
  #  :undo_delete_all [Unsets deleted_at for a collection of records]
  #  :undo_destroy [Unsets deleted_at for a record & invokes callbacks]
  #  :undo_destroy_all [Unsets deleted_at for a collection of records & invokes callbacks]
  #
  # Destroy methods succeed when the ActiveRecord is already marked for deletion or
  # invoked with +:SoftDeletable.allow_active_record_destroy+ block.
  #  :destroy & :destroy_all will only succeed on records that have been marked for deletion.
